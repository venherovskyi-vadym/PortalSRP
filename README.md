# Getting Started

Clone this repository or download the source code from the Releases tab and open it as a Unity project.

In the Unity Editor, select the scene that uses the feature you'd like to reference and hit play.
If you find yourself having problems using our samples, please refer to our [documentation page](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/sample_projects/) for more information.

To build the samples on a mobile device, follow our [Setup Guide.](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/setup/#selecting-your-mobile-platform)

# Recording Datasets for Playback
AR Playback is a new, powerful feature for in-editor testing. The Recording sample will allow you to create your own dataset of an area near you. For more information, see [the Playback documentation](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/features/playback/).

You can also try out the feature with a pre-recorded dataset. Two are available as extra assets in our release:

* [Gandhi Statue](https://github.com/niantic-lightship/ardk-samples/releases/download/3.1.0/GandhiStatue_PlaybackDataset.tgz)

* [Relic Statue](https://github.com/niantic-lightship/ardk-samples/releases/download/3.1.0/Relic_PlaybackDataset.tgz)


After downloading a dataset, extract it to a folder of your choice, then open the Unity Editor to configure your Lightship settings:

1. Open Project Settings from the Edit menu, then scroll down to XR Plugin Management and select Niantic Lightship SDK.
2. Enable Editor Playback, then input the absolute path to your dataset in the Dataset Path field.
